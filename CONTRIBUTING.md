# Code styling
- Add spacing between logical groups of text when possible.
- If there's something that does a fair bit and feels like it should be in a function, then put it in a function.

# Directory layout
- All functions are located in `/src/functions`, with a single function located in each file.
- All function files should end in `.sh`.
- You may (at your discretion) provide a description of what a function does at the top of said function's file.

# Lastly,
These are all just guidelines. Feel free to break the rules if it makes the code more legible.
