This is a basic list of packages that are known to work from the AUR and Arch Linux repositories.

This list is likely incomplete, and more are likely to work.

If you're package isn't listed and you'd like to see if it works - see if it works! If you do, it would be greatly appreciated if you could report back:

1. If it works, or,
2. If it doesn't work, make an issue on what didn't - dependencies, functions in the PKGBUILD, etc.
